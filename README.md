BatchImageEditor
=================

BatchImageEditor is a small command-line tool for batch editing images.
It is designed as a personal side project to quickly apply simple
transformations to many files at once.

Planned features include:
- Resize multiple images to a fixed width or height
- Convert formats (for example, PNG to JPEG)
- Apply simple filters such as grayscale
- Run dry-runs to preview what will be changed

This project is intentionally simple and focused on learning and
experimentation rather than production use.
